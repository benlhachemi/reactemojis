Clone the React Emojis package to your root React project using the following command:

### ‚öôÔ∏è Install Dependencies
To ensure smooth functionality, install the dependencies by running the following command:
```bash
npm install lottie-react
```
:::note

For optimal deployment, it's recommended to install 'lottie-react' in the root package.json of your entire app rather than within the 'react-emojis' folder. This helps prevent dependency issues during deployment.
